Hitwicket Multiplayer Game

Hitwicket is a turn-based, multiplayer game implemented using Node.js and WebSocket, allowing real-time interactions between two players. The game board is a 5x5 grid where each player commands a set of characters, including Pawns and Heroes, to outmaneuver and defeat their opponent. Players take turns moving their characters across the board, with Heroes capable of eliminating opponents in their path. The game seamlessly updates the board in real-time, providing a dynamic and competitive experience. The objective is to eliminate all opponent characters, securing victory. This project demonstrates the use of WebSockets for real-time communication and game state management in a multiplayer environment.
